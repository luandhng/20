        Much of the art I appreciate in museums can be bucketed into aesthetics
        like typographic, medieval, or patterned. The boundaries feel clearly
        defined because we can assign names to them. I have been increasingly
        more stimulated by aesthetic intersections—unexpected displays of art
        that tastefully reject the notion of a clean, singularly defined style,
        yet bridges many. For my taste, often this ends up in opposition to
        minimalism, yet does not chaotically lean into kitschy or maximalism.
        There is authoring intent, purpose, and a sense of iteration felt
        throughout, not seemingly arbitrary excess for the sake of creative
        provocation. I believe there's something fascinating in art and design
        that treats my attention with care and instills curiosity.
